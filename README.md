## TPB IMDB

# TODO:
-   figure out a way to remove everything after 4 reoccuring digits to remove random "BRRIP"-looking parts of strings and thus make results more reliable
-   figure out a a way to cache results so that 100 requests to imdb aren't made everytime a program is run. Least prio.

# Dependencies
-   [IMDbPY](http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net/)
-   [TPB](https://github.com/karan/TPB)
-   Sadly, python2 since the API's aren't compatible with python3+
