# TPB IMDB
A program which looks for the top 100 movies on TPB and gets their ratings from IMDB (or atleast tries to).

## Dependencies
-   [IMDbPY](http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net/)
-   [TPB](https://github.com/karan/TPB)
-   db-sqlite3 from whatever repo pip2 uses
-   Sadly, python2 since the API's aren't compatible with python3+ and I'm too lazy to write one.
